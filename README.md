### Hello ! 👋

My name is Loris, i am 23 years old and i live in Switzerland<br>

I've been coding for years and still enjoy it a lot<br>
I particularly like <b>C</b>, <b>Rust</b> and <b>C#</b><br>
I'll code pretty much anything, as long as it's a challenge or seems fun :D<br>

I studied IT for 4 years at <b>ETML</b><br>
After that, I worked for nearly 2 years at a startup within <b>PL-MTI</b> at <b>EPFL</b><<br>
Now im doing an extra 9-months specialization at <b>Holberton</b>, focusing into low-level<br>

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading (both novels and manga), cooking, watching anime, and gaming.<br>
I’m also into sports, good food (a taco here and there is always welcome!), and laughing—classic stuff.<br>

Oh, and I have a superpower: I can plug in a USB key the right way on the first try. c:
